Following code snippet of `tb_rc5_enc.sv` checks the RTL response for `p=0xFFFF`:\
```
if ((enc_p == 16'hFFFF) && (enc_c == 16'h0703))
    $display("Ciphertext is correct");
```
The above section is present in the verification part of the Testbench. The `enc_p` and `enc_c` are signals mapped to the plaintext and ciphertext of the `rc5_enc_16bit` module. The expected values ciphertext and plaintext are checked to ensure whether the proper ciphertext has been generated by the RC5 encryption module.
